### Async useTransition hook

React, till 17th version had no any proper hook to handle the async changes. But in R18, useTransaction hook enables developers to handle this condition directly ( instead of creating separate hook or handling in a different function ) by giving a boolean `loading` flag.  

In R19, React team goes one step futher and enables the support for async functions with this hook.

#### Sample Snippet

```
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  const getUsersData = () => {
    startTransition(async () => {
        try{
            const data = await getUsers();
            setUsers(data);
        } catch (e) {
            // custom error handling | console.log(e)
        }
    })
  };
```

### Server Actions

Functions ( or Actions ) with labelled as `"use server"` are treated as server actions.

Unlike other general functions ( actions ), server actions are the special kind of functions which are executed at the server side.
This ensures quality time and reduces most of the unnecessary stuffs with regular development.

#### Sample Snippet

```
async fuction getLikes () {
    "use server"
    ...
}
```
